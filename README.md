# BC_C5_Calendar_Appointments

Displays times for a single day and allows a user to input appointmentments.  There is also CSS to show the current time block (in red), past time blocks (in grey) and future time blocks (in green).

## Description

This project was created for allowing practice in manipulating the dom elements 

- This project allowed me to get a better understanding on how to look for ids/classes on the dom and then use js to edit or change them based on criteria.
- I was able to successfully update the index.html to include a 24 hour period each in 1 hour blocks.  Each block has its own <div> with its own class 
- I was able to successfully store the current time and date and display it as part of the header.  Then use that time/date to update the dom and set the class for each div with either a past/present/future to the class
- I was also able to practice saving data to the local store by class
- I was able to practice retrieving data from the local store and placing the data in the correct class.
- I was able to use the exisitn jQuery that was included for the index.js
